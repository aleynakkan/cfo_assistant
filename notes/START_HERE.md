✅ **Includes 2 complete example modals** (reference & learn from)
✅ **Enables incremental migration** (extract one piece at a time)
✅ **Is fully documented** (6 guides + 2 checklists)

## 🔑 Key Principle

### Before (Monolithic)
```
App.jsx (3552 lines)
├─ 50+ useState calls
├─ 10 modals (inline)
├─ Multiple API calls scattered
└─ Hard to maintain
```

### After (Modular)
```
App.jsx (50 lines) ← Routing only
├─ features/dashboard/ (6 components)
├─ features/data/ (10+ components)
├─ api/ (4 API files)
├─ stores/ (Zustand)
└─ Easy to maintain, test, extend
```

**Same behavior, cleaner code!**
